## Status

VibePanel is in early 0.x development but should be stable enough for daily use.
Config options and defaults may change between minor releases, check the changelog when upgrading.

### Compatibility

- **Compositors:** Hyprland, Niri, MangoWC/DWL. Sway support may be added based on demand.
- **Updates widget:** dnf and pacman/paru. More package managers planned.

## Quickstart

1. Install [runtime dependencies](https://github.com/prankstr/vibepanel/wiki/Installation#runtime-dependencies) for your distro.

2. Install VibePanel:

   ```sh
   curl -LO https://github.com/prankstr/vibepanel/releases/latest/download/vibepanel-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
   install -Dm755 vibepanel-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ~/.local/bin/vibepanel
   ```

   Or [build from source](https://github.com/prankstr/vibepanel/wiki/Installation#from-source).

3. Run it:

   ```sh
   vibepanel &
   ```

See [Installation](https://github.com/prankstr/vibepanel/wiki/Installation) for auto-start setup.

## Configuration

VibePanel works without a config file and tries to have sensible defaults while still keeping everything configurable. If you want to customize, create a config at `~/.config/vibepanel/config.toml`:

```sh
touch ~/.config/vibepanel/config.toml
# or generate an example config
vibepanel --print-example-config > ~/.config/vibepanel/config.toml
```

Here's a minimal example:

```toml
[bar]
size = 32

[widgets]
left = ["workspace", "window_title"]
right = ["quick_settings", "battery", "clock", "notifications"]

[theme]
mode = "dark"
accent = "#adabe0"
```

Changes hot-reload instantly. See the [Configuration wiki](https://github.com/prankstr/vibepanel/wiki/Configuration) for all options.

## Vibe Code Disclaimer

As the name suggests, this project is mainly vibe code, i.e responsible AI-assisted development not just blindly accepting outputs. I'm not a Rust developer, nor was I particularly familiar with GTK when I started but it's been a great learning experience. Without AI, VibePanel wouldn't exist but it allowed me to create a bar I actually enjoy using so I'm thankful. I've done my due diligence to ensure the codebase is solid, but you have been warned :)
